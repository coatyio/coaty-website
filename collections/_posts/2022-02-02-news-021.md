Together with our partner [Flexus
AG](https://www.flexus.de/en/){:target="_blank"} in the [FlowPro
project](https://www.flow-pro.de/){:target="_blank"} we published a blog article
"FlowPro - Roadmap to self-organizing logistics" introducing the convergence of
IT and OT technology for self-organizing logistics. The article (German only) is
available
[here](https://www.flexus.de/unternehmen/aktuelles/flowpro-roadmap-zur-selbstorganisierten-logistik){:target="_blank"}.
Coaty is used in FlowPro as base communication technology to establish an AI
empowered transaction network between the different heterogeneous logistic
components.
