Coaty JS release [1.6.0] integrates a new MQTT broker for development and
testing. Due to concerns regarding performance and security vulnerabilities, the
Mosca broker used previously has been replaced by
[Aedes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aedes){:target="_blank"}, a lighweight
barebone broker that installs fast. This broker comes bundled with the Coaty JS
framework. When upgrading your Coaty JS applications, remove/uninstall `mosca`
dependency from package.json.
