The FlowPro Transaction Network Connector has been released on
[GitHub](https://github.com/coatyio/transaction-network-connector){:target="_blank"}.
It has been developed in our publicly funded research project [FlowPro](
https://www.flow-pro.de){:target="_blank"} and serves as the basis for
interaction within a self-organizing multi-agent based micrologistics system.

The Transaction Network Connector uses Coaty and Raft over Coaty as base
communication and consensus technologies. It runs across platforms and is
deployed as a set of platform-specific binaries, a Docker image, and a Node.js
package.
