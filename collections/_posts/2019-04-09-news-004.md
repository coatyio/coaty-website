Coaty JS release 1.5 introduces the
[Call-Return](https://coatyio.github.io/coaty-js/man/developer-guide/#call---return-event-pattern---an-example){:target="_blank"}
communication pattern. Unlike with classic RPC, this one-to-many, two-way
pattern supports non-blocking remote operations to be executed by multiple
Coaty agents. The calling agent can specify a context filter that defines
conditions under which the operation is allowed to be performed.

Typical use cases of the Call-Return pattern include smart distribution of
computational workloads to dedicated worker agents, and non safety critical, non
latency sensitive decentralized command and control applications.

A new best-practice code example on remote operations can be found
[here](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-examples/tree/master/remote-operations/js){:target="_blank"}.
