Coaty will be the core framework for the interaction of the agents inside the
self-organizing multi-agent system for micrologistics in the FlowPro project. It
will realize the loose coupling and decentralized architecture for the
heterogeneous agents representing ground and air-bound vehicles, logistics and
communication infrastructure. In addition, it will integrate the building blocks
for AI, task bidding, security, and external services needed to make the
envisioned FlowPro scenarios possible. FlowPro is a research project publicly
funded by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastucture.
