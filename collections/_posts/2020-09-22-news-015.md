A new binding package
[`@coaty/binding.libp2p`](https://github.com/coatyio/binding.libp2p.js){:target="_blank"}
is available for Coaty JS. It provides a Coaty communication binding for
transmitting Coaty communication events over
[libp2p](https://libp2p.io/){:target="_blank"}, a brokerless peer-to-peer
network stack. Note that this binding is considered experimental for now.

This package comes with complete [API
documentation](https://coatyio.github.io/binding.libp2p.js/api/){:target="_blank"}
and the reference specification of the [Coaty libp2p communication
protocol](https://coatyio.github.io/binding.libp2p.js/man/communication-protocol/){:target="_blank"}.
