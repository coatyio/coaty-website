title: "Raft Consensus Algorithm over Coaty goes open source"
categories: [news]
---

We are excited to announce the first open source release of a [Raft Consensus
Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/){:target="_blank"} over Coaty implemented as
a TypeScript/JavaScript library. Raft is a protocol with which a cluster of
decentralized nodes can maintain a replicated state machine that is kept in sync
through the use of a replicated log. The library uses the Coaty Framework for
communication between nodes as well as for some aspects of persistency and
cluster configuration.

The library is available as an npm package named
[@coaty/consensus.raft](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coaty/consensus.raft){:target="_blank"}.
Sources and documentation can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/coatyio/consensus.raft.js){:target="_blank"}.
