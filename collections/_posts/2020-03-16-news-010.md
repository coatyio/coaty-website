We are excited to announce a new major open source release of the Coaty
framework, available in JavaScript/TypeScript and Swift.

Coaty 2 incorporates experience and feedback gathered with Coaty 1. It pursues
the main goal to streamline and simplify the framework API, to get rid of unused
and deprecated functionality, and to prepare for future extensions.

Among other changes, Coaty 2 features

* cleaned up Coaty object types,
* a simplified and more efficient distributed lifecycle management,
* redesigned Smart Routing by generalizing and broadening its scope,
* communication namespaces to restrict delivery of events,
* an optimized communication protocol.

Note that the essential set of communication event patterns didn't change.

For the next minor release Coaty 2.1 we plan to introduce "communication
bindings", a mechanism to make Coaty's underlying publish-subscribe messaging
protocol interchangeable, while keeping the set of communication event patterns
and your application code unaffected.

Coaty 2 applications are no longer backward-compatible and interoperable with
Coaty 1 applications. The [Coaty JS Migration

and the [Coaty Swift Migration
Guide](https://coatyio.github.io/coaty-swift/man/migration-guide/){:target="_blank"}
describe (breaking) changes and how to upgrade your Coaty 1 applications to
Coaty 2.
