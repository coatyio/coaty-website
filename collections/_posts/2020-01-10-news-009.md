We have released a [Coaty JS extension
package](https://github.com/coatyio/connector.opc-ua.js){:target="_blank"} that
seamlessly connects decentralized Coaty applications with OPC UA servers. It
provides specialized controllers to transform OPC UA data sources into Coaty
Sensor Things, IO routing sources/actors, and raw MQTT messages, and to map
Coaty remote operation calls to OPC UA method calls.

It comes with complete API documentation and an example project that
demonstrates best practices and typical usage patterns.
