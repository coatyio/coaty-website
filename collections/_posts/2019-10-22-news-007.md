Today we are excited to announce
[Coaty Swift](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-swift){:target="_blank"}, a Swift
version of the Coaty framework targeted at native iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
applications. Coaty Swift comes with everything you need to build awesome
collaborative apps, including:

* a tutorial and best practice example projects,
* a developer guide,
* framework API documentation.

We hope you love it. ❤️ Give it a try and let us know what you think!

Our special thanks go to [Sandra](https://github.com/melloskitten) and
[Johannes](https://github.com/johannesrohwer), who did a great contribution in
developing Coaty Swift.
