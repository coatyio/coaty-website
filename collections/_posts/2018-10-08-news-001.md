We are excited to announce the first open source release of the Coaty framework,
a cross-platform implementation targeted at JavaScript/TypeScript. It can be used to
implement collaborative applications running as mobile or web apps in the browser or
as Node.js services. Coaty JavaScript is available as an npm package named
[coaty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coaty). Sources and documentation can be found
[here](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-js).
