Coaty JS v2.1 introduces *communication bindings*, a mechanism to make Coaty's
underlying publish-subscribe messaging protocol interchangeable, while keeping
the set of communication event patterns and your application code unaffected.

The default communication binding - MQTT with JSON-UTF8 payload encoding - is
backward-compatible with Coaty 2 releases of Coaty JS and Coaty Swift. The
[communication binding
API](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-js/blob/master/src/com/communication-binding.ts#L247){:target="_blank"}
is considered experimental until Coaty 3.
