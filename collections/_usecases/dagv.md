A driverless transport system where all jobs are managed dynamically and without
central authorities. Coaty builds the communication foundation to advertise jobs,
discover necessary resources, and negotiate assignments in a decentralized way.
Operation autonomy in technical and business sense is transferred as close as
possible to heterogenous devices (e.g. SIMOVE, proANT).
