The [FlowPro
project](https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/flowpro.html)
researches technologies ​for future micrologistic systems integrating
decentrally organized ​heterogeneous ground and air-bound ​autonomous transport
units. Coaty is used to implement the interaction backbone for the envisioned
self-organizing logistic multi-agent system.
