Using the SIMOVE AGV system platform, Siemens demonstrates how AGV machine
builders benefit from reduced planning and engineering effort as well as
shorter commissioning times, and how users can design their logistics
processes more flexibly and productively. Coaty will be used to realize
next generation solutions that provide operation autonomy in decentralized
dynamic ad-hoc scenarios.
