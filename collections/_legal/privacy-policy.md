#### Siemens Privacy Policy

Protecting the security and privacy of your personal data is important to Siemens.
Therefore, the Siemens company referred to under "Corporate Information" ("Siemens")
operates its websites in compliance with applicable laws on data privacy protection
and data security.

In the following, we provide information on the kinds of data we collect on this
website, the purposes for which we use such data, and the parties with which we
share such data, where applicable.

##### Collected data and purpose of processing

We collect personal data (e.g., names, addresses, telephone numbers, or e-mail addresses)
in connection with the operation of this website only when you have voluntarily provided
such data to us (e.g., through registration, contact inquiries, surveys, etc.) and when we
are entitled to process or use such data by virtue of permission granted by you or on the
basis of a statutory provision.

As a general rule, we use such data only for the purpose for which you divulged the data to
us, such as to answer your inquiries, process your orders, or grant you access to certain
information or offerings.

##### Sharing of data

Insofar as you have provided your consent or when we are otherwise legally entitled to do so,
we will share your personal data with subsidiaries of Siemens, where applicable, for the
purposes indicated above.

In connection with the operation of its website and the services provided by way of the website,
Siemens works with service providers such as hosting or IT maintenance service providers, for example.

These recipients may possibly be located in countries outside of the European Economic Area
("third countries"), in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection
as in your home country. In such cases, Siemens takes measures to ensure an appropriate level of data
privacy protection. For example, we share your personal data with Siemens subsidiaries in third
countries only if they have implemented our Binding Corporate Rules ("BCR") for the protection of
personal data. You will find additional information on the Siemens BCR here.

Data is shared only in connection with and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
We do not sell or otherwise market your personal data to third parties.

##### Questions and comments

Siemens will respond to all legitimate requests for information and where applicable, to correct,
amend, or delete your personal data. If you wish to make such a request or if you have questions
or comments about this privacy policy, please contact us.
