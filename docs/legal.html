<p>Protecting the security and privacy of your personal data is important to Siemens.
Therefore, the Siemens company referred to under “Corporate Information” (“Siemens”)
operates its websites in compliance with applicable laws on data privacy protection
and data security.</p>

<p>In the following, we provide information on the kinds of data we collect on this
website, the purposes for which we use such data, and the parties with which we
share such data, where applicable.</p>

<h5 id="collected-data-and-purpose-of-processing">Collected data and purpose of processing</h5>

<p>We collect personal data (e.g., names, addresses, telephone numbers, or e-mail addresses)
in connection with the operation of this website only when you have voluntarily provided
such data to us (e.g., through registration, contact inquiries, surveys, etc.) and when we
are entitled to process or use such data by virtue of permission granted by you or on the
basis of a statutory provision.</p>

<p>As a general rule, we use such data only for the purpose for which you divulged the data to
us, such as to answer your inquiries, process your orders, or grant you access to certain
information or offerings.</p>

<h5 id="sharing-of-data">Sharing of data</h5>

<p>Insofar as you have provided your consent or when we are otherwise legally entitled to do so,
we will share your personal data with subsidiaries of Siemens, where applicable, for the
purposes indicated above.</p>

<p>In connection with the operation of its website and the services provided by way of the website,
Siemens works with service providers such as hosting or IT maintenance service providers, for example.</p>

<p>These recipients may possibly be located in countries outside of the European Economic Area
(“third countries”), in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection
as in your home country. In such cases, Siemens takes measures to ensure an appropriate level of data
privacy protection. For example, we share your personal data with Siemens subsidiaries in third
countries only if they have implemented our Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”) for the protection of
personal data. You will find additional information on the Siemens BCR here.</p>

<p>Data is shared only in connection with and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
We do not sell or otherwise market your personal data to third parties.</p>

<h5 id="questions-and-comments">Questions and comments</h5>

<p>Siemens will respond to all legitimate requests for information and where applicable, to correct,
amend, or delete your personal data. If you wish to make such a request or if you have questions
or comments about this privacy policy, please contact us.</p>

            <h4 id="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</h4>

<h5 id="1-scope">1. Scope</h5>

<p>1.1. Any use of this web site provided by Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and/or
its affiliates (“Siemens”), “Siemens Web Site”, is subject to these Terms of

companies or enterprises are represented by the user and must assume that the
user has appropriate knowledge and acts accordingly.</p>

<p>1.3. If the User uses this Siemens Web Site as business customer, i.e. that it
is not acting for purposes which are outside its trade, business or profession,
or as administration customer, § 312i para. 1 sentence 1 no. 1 - 3 of the German
Civil Code does not apply.</p>

accept any liability for the continuous availability of the Siemens Web Site.</p>

<h5 id="3-registration-password">3. Registration, Password</h5>

<p>3.1. Some pages of the Siemens Web Site may be password protected. In the interest
of safety and security of the business transactions, only registered Users may

previously freely accessible, subject to registration. Siemens is entitled, at
any time and without obligation to give reasons, to deny the User the right to
access the password-protected area by blocking its User Data (as defined below),
in particular if the User</p>

<ul>
  <li>uses false data for the purpose of registration;</li>
  <li>violates these Terms of Use or neglects its duty of care with regard to User Data;</li>
  <li>violates any applicable laws in the access to or use of the Siemens Web Site; or</li>
  <li>did not use the Siemens Web Site for a longer period.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.2. For registration the User shall give accurate information and, where such
information changes over time, update such information (to the extent possible:

supplied to Siemens, is current at all times and an address at which the User
can be contacted.</p>

<p>3.3. Upon registration the User will be provided with an access
code, comprising a User ID and a password (“User Data”). On first access the User
shall promptly change the password received from Siemens into a password known only
to the User. The User Data allows the User to view or change its data or, as
applicable, to withdraw its consent to data processing.</p>

<p>3.4. The User shall ensure that User Data is not accessible by third parties and is
liable for all transactions and other activities carried out under its User Data.
At the end of each online session, the User shall log-off from the password protected

password-protected area under such User Data. Access by the User will only be possible
again upon the User’s application to Siemens or upon new registration. 3.6. The User may
at any time request termination of its registration in writing, provided that the deletion
will not violate the proper performance of contractual relationships. In such event Siemens
will remove all user data and other stored personally identifiable data of the User as soon
as these data are no longer needed.</p>

<h5 id="4-rights-of-use-to-information-software-and-documentation">4. Rights of Use to Information, Software and Documentation</h5>

<p>4.1. The use of any information, software and documentation made available on or via this
Siemens Web Site is subject to these Terms of Use or, in case of updating information, software

shall make the source code available in return for the payment of costs.</p>

<p>4.4. Information, software and documentation may not be distributed by the User to any third party
at any time nor may it be rented or in any other way made available. Unless such is allowed by

for the contents and information given thereon. The use of such web pages shall be
at the sole risk of the User.</p>

<h5 id="8-liability-for-defects-of-title-or-quality">8. Liability for defects of title or quality</h5>

<p>8.1. Insofar as any information, software or documentation is made available at no cost,

for purpose are excluded except for cases involving willful misconduct or fraud.</p>

<p>8.2. The information on the Siemens Web Site may contain specifications or general
descriptions related to the technical possibilities of individual products which may
not be available in certain cases (e.g. due to product changes). The required performance
of the product shall therefore be mutually agreed in each case at the time of purchase.</p>

<h5 id="9-other-liability-viruses">9. Other Liability, Viruses</h5>

<p>9.1. The liability of Siemens for defects in relation to quality and title shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of § 8 of these Terms of Use. Any
further liability of Siemens is excluded unless required by law, e.g. under the
Act on Product Liability or in cases of willful misconduct, gross negligence,
personal injury or death, failure to meet guaranteed characteristics, fraudulent

contract-typical, foreseeable damage if there is no willful misconduct or gross negligence.</p>

<p>9.2. Although Siemens makes every endeavor to keep the Siemens Web Site free from viruses,
Siemens cannot make any guarantee that it is virus-free. The User shall, for its own protection,
take the necessary steps to ensure appropriate security measures and shall utilize a virus
scanner before downloading any information, software or documentation.</p>

<p>9.3. §§ 9.1 and 9.2 do not intend nor imply any changes to the burden of proof to the
User’s disadvantage.</p>

Siemens to a third party, the User shall comply with all applicable national
and international (re-) export control regulations. In any event of such transfer
the User shall comply with the (re-) export control regulations of the Federal
Republic of Germany, of the European Union and of the United States of America.</p>

<p>10.2. Prior to any such transfer to a third party the User shall in particular
check and guarantee by appropriate measures that</p>

<ul>
  <li>There will be no infringement of an embargo imposed by the European Union,
by the United States of America and/ or by the United Nations by such transfer
or by provision of other economic resources in connection with information,
software and documentation provided by Siemens, also considering the limitations
of domestic business and prohibitions of by-passing those embargos;</li>
  <li>Such information, software and documentation provided by Siemens are not intended
for use in connection with armaments, nuclear technology or weapons, if and to
the extent such use is subject to prohibition or authorization, unless required
authorization is provided;</li>
  <li>The regulations of all applicable Sanctioned Party Lists of the European Union
and the United States of America concerning the trading with entities, persons
and organizations listed therein are considered.</li>
</ul>

existing.</p>

<p>10.4. The User shall indemnify and hold harmless Siemens from and against any claim,
proceeding, action, fine, loss, cost and damages arising out of or relating to any
noncompliance with export control regulations by the User, and the User shall
compensate Siemens for all losses and expenses resulting thereof, unless such
noncompliance was not caused by fault of the User. This provision does not imply
a change in burden of proof.</p>

<p>10.5. Siemens’ obligation to fulfill an agreement is subject to the proviso that
the fulfillment is not prevented by any impediments arising out of national and
international foreign trade and customs requirements or any embargos or other
sanctions.</p>
